## v1.0.4 – Verification & Telemetry Release

### Added
- verify mode with size comparison and rsync dry-run validation
- optional telemetry backend (MySQL / InfluxDB)
- structured run lifecycle (open / events / close)
- config initialization via --init-config
- hierarchical config precedence model
- safer restore workflow (CLI-only FORCE, interactive confirmation)

### Changed
- internal execution flow cleanup
- stricter error handling and exit code propagation
- improved logging and state tracking

### Security
- host-specific configs excluded from git
- no credentials in repository
- restore cannot run headless

### Notes
- Designed for ZFS-backed datasets
- rsync checksum verification intentionally omitted for performance reasons
