v1.1.5
  Defaulted SERVICE_START_AFTER to be unset and have check_service_running persist SERVICE_WAS_RUNNING while deriving a start-after default when unspecified, so headless runs can restore prior state safely.
  Added a backup cleanup trap to restart services on error paths during backup execution, while keeping normal start behavior intact.
  snapshot: trimmed seconds from snapname, conforming to TrueNAS naming scheme
  Improvements in the handling of chia
  get_block_height: from service checked and adjusted; from logfile in preparation for reintegration
  STATEFILE temporary relocated, please adapt to your own environment
